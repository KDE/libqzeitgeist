/**
 * @class Log log.h log.h
 * @brief Primary access point for talking to the Zeitgeist daemon.
 *
 * @Log encapsulates the low level access to the Zeitgeist daemon.
 * You can use it to manage the log by inserting and deleting entries as well
 * as do queries on the logged data.
 *
 * It's important to realize that the Log class does not expose
 * any API that does synchronous communications with the message bus -
 * everything is asynchronous. Thus, instead of the real result, each
 * asynchronous operation will return a DBus pending reply object, that can
 * be used to watch and fetch the real operation return/result.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * QDBusPendingCall async = log->asyncCall(value1, value2);
 * QDBusPendingCallWatcher *watcher = new QDBusPendingCallWatcher(async, this);
 *
 * QObject::connect(watcher, SIGNAL(finished(QDBusPendingCallWatcher*)),
 *                  this, SLOT(callFinishedSlot(QDBusPendingCallWatcher*)));
 *
